# Loadbalancer Overview

The 'loadbalancer' project is the main component of the technical audition, and comprises a simple Java-based layer 4
load balancer. The load balancer listens for the execution of the REST endpoint contained within the 'technical' project
and assigns the IP address to one of two servers via a simple 'round robin' approach.

## Notes
Due to time pressure, the loadbalancer project is incomplete. An attempt was made to recognise endpoint executions via
IP addresses, however as cloud services are not permitted, this proved difficult.

## Further work
As mentioned, the project is incomplete, due primarily to time pressure. Future work would include:

1. Altering either the load balancer or the 'technical' project to accept variations in ports as opposed to IP addresses, thereby
significantly reducing complexity.
2. Continuing the iterative approach towards the project and replacing the 'round robin' strategy with a random selection
algorithm.
3. Add functionality to handle server failure or redundancy.
4. Add functionality to add further servers, should the workload of existing servers be exhausted.
5. Significantly improve test coverage, and replace printed lines with logger messages.
